Hello, I'm Erico Silva! I'm an Electrical Engineer with major in Computers and Digital Systems. I've graduated in December 2014 by the University of Sao Paulo Polytechnic School (POLI-USP), in Brazil. I also spent a year in the University of California, Berkeley, in USA.

When I was a child I wanted to be an inventor: I wanted to solve problems, I wanted to create things and see them working. As an engineering student, I've found in coding what I was looking for. It's so easy to build things, yet it is so powerful. I simply like this tech world I'm into.

I'm currently working in a startup in Sao Paulo, which will be the source for most of my posts.

Hope you find it useful!
